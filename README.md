# Full Stack Development I
In this full stack project, I employed three different approaches to frontend development: traditional Express HTML templating, JavaScript for interactive elements, and a single-page application (SPA) framework for the administrative interface. Express HTML was used to render the customer-facing website on the server side, providing dynamically generated content that supports SEO and ensures efficient initial page loads. JavaScript added interactivity to the site, enabling features such as form validation and real-time updates to enhance the user experience. For the admin interface, I used a SPA framework, which delivered a more responsive and seamless experience by dynamically updating content without requiring full page reloads. The backend was built with a NoSQL MongoDB database, chosen for its flexibility and scalability. Its schema-less design allowed for seamless adaptation to changing requirements, making it an ideal choice for handling the semi-structured data in this application.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) played a critical role in tying the frontend and backend together by serving as a lightweight, text-based format for exchanging data. Unlike JavaScript, which is a programming language, JSON is used for structuring and transmitting data between systems. This format enabled a smooth integration of components, ensuring consistent communication across the stack. To improve functionality and efficiency, I refactored code during the project, including abstracting repetitive form validation logic into reusable functions. On the SPA side, I created modular UI components such as reusable modals and table layouts. This approach streamlined development, reduced redundancy, and made the codebase more maintainable and scalable for future updates.

Testing was a crucial part of the development process, particularly for verifying the functionality and security of API endpoints. Using tools like Postman and automated tests, I ensured that HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE worked as intended. Incorporating security features, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for secure authentication and authorization, added complexity to testing. This required simulating both valid and invalid access scenarios to confirm that only authorized users could access sensitive data. By thoroughly testing endpoints and security layers, I ensured the reliability and robustness of the application.

Reflecting on this course, I can confidently say it has significantly advanced my professional goals by providing hands-on experience with full stack development. Building a complete web application from start to finish has deepened my understanding of frontend-backend integration, secure web application development, and the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js). This experience has honed my ability to think critically about application architecture, write efficient and reusable code, and implement security best practices. These skills make me a more competitive candidate in the tech industry, prepared to meet the challenges of modern web application development.
